By efficiently bringing supply voltages to the lower end of the statutory voltage range, voltage optimisation technology could yield average energy savings of around 13%.\n3. A VO device will lower the voltage to the most efficient level to maximise the savings on electricity consumption, so you may notice certain things taking a little longer, such as a kettle may take a little longer to boil.\n4.

    "Sure, here is the passage:\n\nParagraph 1:\n\nAfter being benched with a DNP-Coach\u2019s Decision in Miami, Mahinmi responded with seven strong games in March where he averaged 9 points and 6 rebounds in 17.6 minutes per game. His poor hands also make it difficult to run offense into the paint because his man typically helps off and bets on Mahinmi fumbling any drop off passes. Although he will be 32 early next season, if he can stay healthy, then he can at least be a net neutral on the court.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\nMahinmi's limited athleticism and size makes it difficult to be an effective defensive player. He lacks the lateral quickness to stay in front of quicker players and his lack of vertical jump limits his ability to challenge shots. However, he is a good positional defender who is smart and disciplined, which allows him to make up for his physical limitations. Mahinmi is also a good rebounder for his size and can be an effective finisher around the basket.",

    "\n1) The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has increased access to health care for millions of Americans. It has also brought in additional taxes and spending to help pay for the new coverage and benefits. Repealing Obamacare would increase Medicare spending by $802 billion over 10 years, according to estimates by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The White House estimated that the typical Medicare beneficiary is paying about $700 less in premium and cost sharing this year because of slower growth in costs. This provision would disappear under a full repeal.\n2) Obamacare has had a significant impact on access to health care in the United States.

While there are several ways to do this, such as clarifying liability laws, a key way is through better security signaling: recognizable, trusted methods for signaling levels of security so that consumers can factor it into their buying habits.
